Bugfix[WGS_Stats_v1.java]: The Size of each Chromosome registered in the header of the "*wholeGenomeCov.fasta" was reported as (Size+1) and is now fixed. (Eg: >1 1 249250622, Should Be: >1 1 249250621)
Bugfix[WGS_Stats_v1.java]: covHistio_WG variable was defined  as 'int' and could go over the data type limit while handling whole genome samples. This is now changed to 'long'.
Bugfix[batch_*_Lowcov.bed]: There was an extra tab between the 'length' and 'gene' fields. The file has been fixed to match the Headers.
Bugfix[batch_*_Lowcov.bed]: Interval length now matches length of 0-based genome coordinate positions in 'batch_*_Lowcov.bed' file.
Bugfix[ExCID.BatchScript_v2.1-threading_Final.pl]: Targets BED file with more than 3 columns were not handled correctly in the Annotation step. This has been fixed and will now allow BED file with more than 3 columns as Input.
Bugfix[ExCID.BatchScript_v2.1-threading_Final.pl]: In Batch mode, while obtaining the Gene% coverage, '-checkHGMD' was applied as a mandatory option. This has been corrected and is changed to optional.
Bugfix: An assumption made in "ExCID.grep_gene_list_pct_Final-miRNA.pl" and "ExCID.grep_gene_list_pct_Final.pl" scripts about the location of the database files. This has been fixed to obtain the location from the Config.txt .
Bugfix[CapStatsV2.6.java]: A VERSION variable is used to write the version in the *.csv file.

Devel[batch_*_Lowcov.bed]: The format of the file will be changed to 1-based making it consistent with all other Outputs.
Devel[WGS_Stats_v1.java]: There is an extra 0 at the start of coverage information of each chromosome in the Ò*wholeGenomeCov.fastaÓ output file, that needs to be removed.
